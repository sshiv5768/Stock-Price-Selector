## Technologies included..
- Python
- Streamlit(Python lib)
- Yfinance(Python lib)

## How to use..
You just have to type the name of company stocks and you will see the whole graph. Currently it is set for only past one month stock graph so you will see one month stock prices of that particular company.

## Updates..
I want to attach an ML model so that it can predict future stock prices of any specific company using its previous stock data.
